    There is no local tokenizer here and adding one to clamp a budget would be

    prompt of 3100 English characters counted 667 tokens, 0.22 a character,
    while the same prose written in Chinese costs 0.63, because a Han character
    is nearly a token by itself.

    Charging a Chinese prompt a quarter-token a character therefore under-counts
    it two and a half times over, and under-counting is the one direction that
    hurts: the budget leaves room that was never there, the provider refuses the
    request for its size anyway, and by then the ceiling is known — which is
    exactly the case where `_create` re-raises instead of retrying. So CJK
    codepoints are counted at `CJK_CHARS_PER_TOKEN` and the rest at
    `CHARS_PER_TOKEN`, which over-estimates both scripts — Chinese by about
